# Law firm site
This is the first of many projects by **The Breaking Benjamins** ("TBB") -- a group of legendary coders from all around 'Merica.

The final deliverable can be found [here.](https://jnolan97.github.io/LawFirmSite/)

You may find the original requirenments [here.](https://classroom.google.com/c/OTQ5OTQ1MDk1MDNa/a/MTAwMTAxODgxMjQ1/details)

In summary, TBB was tasked with:
* Replicating a website for a law firm
* Working remotely using GitHub

## Main page & Logo(s)/Header
The main page displays:
* a nav bar with all sections of the site, 
* a main photo, 
* a welcome message, 
* a scroll-enabled news feed, and, 
* an address section with contact info.

The "logo" in this site is actually a combination of an art icon and the firm's name. Technically, it's two logos in one. No functionality to them.

## What We Do & Nav bar
The What We Do pag displays:
* images with borders,
* a list to the side of the page,
* navbar and,
* a footer linking to other pages on the site.

Nav bar contains links to more information about the company. "WHO WE ARE" and "WHAT WE DO" tabs link to other pages within the website.

## Who We Are & Footer
The Who We Are page displays 
* a column with text and an image. 
* It also shows a text area on the right followed by five placeholder images with borders. 
* The nav bar and footer allow the user to navigate to other pages within the site.

Styled a footer with links resembling that of the mockup page. The links take you from page to page.
